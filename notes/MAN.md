## Command on UNIX

Here is the diagram illustrating how to use the 'man' command on UNIX platforms and how the pages are organized:


## Structure


Here is the diagram illustrating the structure of 'man' pages on UNIX platforms:

![[man-structure.svg]]


brief description of what you can expect to find in each section of a UNIX man page:

1. **Name**: This section provides the name of the command or function, followed by a one-line description of what it does.
    
2. **Synopsis**: This section provides a brief summary of how the command or function is used, including any options and arguments it may take.
    
3. **Description**: This section provides a detailed description of what the command or function does. It may include explanations of the options and arguments listed in the synopsis.
    
4. **Options**: This section provides a list of the options that the command or function can take, along with a description of what each option does.
    
5. **Files**: This section lists the files that are associated with the command or function. This could include configuration files, log files, or any other files that are read or written by the command.
    
6. **See Also**: This section provides references to other related man pages.
    
7. **Bugs**: This section lists any known bugs or issues with the command or function. Not all man pages will have this section, as not all commands or functions have known bugs.
    
8. **Author**: This section provides information about who wrote the man page, which is not necessarily the same person who wrote the command or function. This section is not present in all man pages.

## Examples of how to use the `man` command in UNIX

1. **Viewing a man page**: To view the man page for a specific command, you simply type `man` followed by the name of the command. For example, to view the man page for the `ls` command, you would type:

```bash
man ls
```

This will bring up the man page for the `ls` command, which you can scroll through using the arrow keys or space bar.

2. **Searching for a man page**: If you're not sure what command you're looking for, you can use the `-k` option with `man` to search the short descriptions and manual page names for a particular keyword. For example, to search for commands related to 'directory', you would type:

```bash
man -k directory
```

This will return a list of commands and functions that have 'directory' in their name or short description.

3. **Viewing a specific section of a man page**: Man pages are divided into sections, as described in the previous message. If you know the section number you're interested in, you can specify it when you call `man`. For example, to view the 'System Calls' section of the man page for `open`, you would type:

```bash
man 2 open
```

This will bring up the 'System Calls' section of the `open` man page.

4. **Navigating a man page**: When viewing a man page, you can navigate through it using the following keys:

- `Space`: Scroll down one page
- `b`: Scroll up one page
- `Arrow keys`: Scroll up or down one line
- `/`: Search for a specific term
- `n`: Go to the next occurrence of the search term
- `q`: Quit the man page viewer
